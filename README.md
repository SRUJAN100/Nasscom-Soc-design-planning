# Nasscom-Soc-design-planning Workshop (December 11-December 24)

This repository houses materials, resources, and examples from the Digital VLSI System-on-Chip (SoC) Design and Implementation Workshop. The workshop is designed to familiarize participants with the principles of digital VLSI circuit design, as well as the key stages of SoC development, including architecture, simulation, and real-world implementation. Emphasis is placed on hands-on learning and industry-relevant techniques for creating high-performance SoCs.
